# Data Cleansing Tutorial: Car Survey Data

This project demonstrates how to clean, analyze, and visualize messy car survey data collected by pupils. It provides a step-by-step workflow in Python (Jupyter Notebook) and includes instructions for performing the same analysis in Excel using Power Query and Pivot Tables.

## Features
- Realistic, messy CSV data files for hands-on data cleaning practice
- Jupyter Notebook tutorial covering:
  - Data import and exploration
  - Handling missing and unknown values
  - Data cleaning and standardization (car colours, makes, models, etc.)
  - Feature engineering
  - Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
  - Merging data from multiple groups
  - Interactive analysis with ipywidgets
- Excel instructions for Power Query and Pivot Table analysis

## Files
- `data_cleansing_tutorial.ipynb` — Main Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step data cleaning and analysis
- `dirty_data1.csv`, `dirty_data2.csv`, `dirty_data3.csv` — Example messy data files
- `Excel_Traffic_Data_Analysis_Instructions.md` — Guide for doing the same analysis in Excel

## Getting Started
1. **Clone this repository** and open in VS Code or JupyterLab.
2. **Install dependencies** (Python 3.8+, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ipywidgets):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets
   ```
3. **Open `data_cleansing_tutorial.ipynb`** and run the cells in order. Each step includes a guiding question and builds on the previous.
4. **Try the Excel workflow** by following the instructions in `Excel_Traffic_Data_Analysis_Instructions.md`.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand the importance of rule-based, repeatable data cleaning
- Learn to handle missing, inconsistent, and unknown values
- Practice feature engineering and visualization
- Explore interactive data analysis in Python and Excel
